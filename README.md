# Physics Mini Projects in Python

This repository contains three beginner-level physics-based Python projects.  
Each project focuses on applying programming fundamentals to real scientific problems.

---

# 📌 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Apply Python programming to physics problems
- Strengthen logical thinking using loops and conditionals
- Practice data structures like lists and dictionaries
- Implement Object-Oriented Programming
- Perform basic scientific computations and visualization

# ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python (3.x) is installed.

### 1️⃣ Plasma Temperature Classifier
Classifies plasma based on temperature ranges.

Run:
python assignment_task1.py

---

### 2️⃣ Material Properties Lookup
Stores material properties, allows adding new materials, and generates comparison plots.

Install dependency (first time only):
pip install matplotlib

Run:
python assignment_task2.py
